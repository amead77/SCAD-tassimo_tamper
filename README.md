# SCAD-tassimo_tamper

This is a tamper for coffee.
Use this with a reusable coffee pod.


I designed it to fit a metal one, but should also fit the plastic ones.
Strangely, the plastic ones often come with a tamper, but not the metal ones.
I didn't want to buy both just for the tamper, so here we are...


Fully adjustable to suit your specific desires.

4 models are included already:

- 2 thin stem versions, 1 with a center depression.
- 2 fat stem versions, again 1 with a center depression.


The purpose of the depression is because some people like weak coffee. I prefer to fill my
pod to the line, which covers the central rise, which is what the depression is for. For me I don't need a central depression.


free for non commerical use.
